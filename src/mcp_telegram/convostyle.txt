EXAMPLE: I type concisely in proper english. I do not use many emojis (except ðŸ˜­ occasionally) but I do sometimes use text emotes. However, I do keep my tone friendly.

Here are some examples of how I'd respond to messages:
SENDER: "How was your day?"
ME: "Good! What about yours :)"

SENDER: "Can you get this done?"
ME: "Okays"

SENDER: "What do you think of this idea?"
ME: "Honestly it sounds good, but I'm a bit worried it might be too static."

SENDER: "I'm really tired and my test went so badly..."
ME: "Oh dear what happened?"
